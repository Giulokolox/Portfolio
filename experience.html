                        but he will never be alone; there will be a curious entity with him that will constantly observe him.

                    On the other side of the planet two masked Kaijus are beating the sh*t out of eachother.

                    You can play in Singleplayer or Local Multiplayer!
                    Fight solo or against your kaiju friends and unmask their intentions!

                    We recommend using at least a controller to play.
                    Theres no mouse support.

        <div class="work-card">
            <p class="description">
                I've been working for almost a year at a startup called Alter Learning, a company that creates educational video games for children, 
                featuring various engaging learning-through-play mechanics. I'm a Unity software developer, working on several games, including Music Hall, 
                Happy Belly, Quiz Rush, Maze Puzzle, and Messy Skelly. Of these games, I've focused in particular on Music Hall and Messy Skelly, 
                the latter of which I developed entirely on my own. Below are links to the company and the two games mentioned above.
                Due to company privacy, visuals cannot be shared.
